    "### Carbon partitioning and plant growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Allocation or partitioning of the photosynthates is a critical element to determine their destination and fate as to how and in what part they will be used. For example, some assimilates will be transported to roots to function as subsrates for providing ATPs to maintain the ion gradients while others can be invested back to build more new leaves. More investment in photosynthetic machinery (i.e. allocation to foliage) will yield greater return of biomass at a faster rate; this is similar to the growth of bank account balance with the compound interest rate. \n",

    "  \n",
    "This model is simple but elegant and is robustly grounded in the ecophysiology to provide critical insights for understanding the intricate relationships between the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, and carbon allocation, and their trade-offs determining the growth of plants. The **tradeoffs** of allocating photosynthates between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic parts can be particularly insightful and relevant for the growth of crops like lettuce and cabbage for which the foliage biomass accounts for the majority of harvested yield or crops with large underground storage organs like radish, potato, garlic, onions, and taro. Carbon allocation to non-photosynthetic parts is also functionally important in  herbaceous perennials with storage organs such as rhizomes and woody plants for which dead parts (i.e. wood and bark) continue to be part of the whole-plant biomass."
